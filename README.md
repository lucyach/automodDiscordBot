# automodDiscordBot

JRBot is an automod Discord bot that watches for certain words. Only a few certain words. It will automatically delete the message, send a message to the person who has sworn in the public chat, and send a message to the staff channel, detailing who swore and what they said. It also counts how many violations a member of a Discord server has and relays this to the staff chat. Slurs are censored with an extra message detailing who should not say them, as well as the message to the staff chat.

This took about an hour and a half to code. It is running on repl, using uptimerobot. The bot will not be public to add to servers. Use the code yourself.
