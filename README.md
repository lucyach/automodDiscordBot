# automodDiscordBot

JRBot is an automod Discord bot that watches for certain words. Only a few certain words. It will authomatically delete the message, send a message to the person who has sworn, and send a message to the staff chat, detailing who swore and what they said. It also counts how many violations a member of a Discord server has and relays this to the staff chat. Slurs are censored with an extra message detailing who should not say them, as well as the message to the staff chat.
